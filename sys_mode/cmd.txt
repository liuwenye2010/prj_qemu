In the Environment submenu, we will configure U-Boot so that it stores its environment
inside a file called uboot.env in a FAT filesystem on an MMC/SD card, as our emulated
machine won’t have flash storage:
– Unset Environment in flash memory (CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FLASH)
– Set Environment is in a FAT filesystem (CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FAT)
– Set Name of the block device for the environment (CONFIG_ENV_FAT_INTERFACE):
mmc
– Device and partition for where to store the environment in FAT (CONFIG_ENV_
FAT_DEVICE_AND_PART): 0:1
The above two settings correspond to the arguments of the fatload command.
Also add support for the editenv (CONFIG_CMD_EDITENV) and bootd (which can be abbreviated
as boot, CONFIG_CMD_BOOTD) that are not present in the default configuration for
our board.
